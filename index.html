                            <p class="descr">If you are ready to place an order for a custom guitar, please download the form bellow, file it and send it back to me via e-mail.</p>
                            <p class="descr">If any option does not suit your needs, please notify it in your e-mail.
                                We can work together to make it happen.</p>
                            <p class="descr">After receiving your order form, I will send you a complete invoice with all the details. A 50% deposit is needed to get you on the build list and start your instrument. Build time is generaly 4 months and wait time depends on the current workload I have. The deposit is non refundable and it is your responsability to have the money ready for final payment once the instrument is ready to ship.</p>
                            <p class="descr">Communication is very important for me and you will get multiple updates and pictures of the build process. I usually answer any questions within 24h 7/7.</p>
                            <p class="descr">I thank you in advance for doing buisness with me.</p>

                                <h2>S4</h2>
                                <p class="descr">The idea for the S4 model came when I was making a custom body inspired by the Danelectro 1451 for my dear friend Kosta. While redesigning the pickguard, I decided it could be fun to make a body with a similar shape and turn it into a brand new model.</br></br>Taking cues from the Explorer, Firebird, Danelectro Pro and Ernie Ball St. Vincent models,</br>the S4 is a streamlined offset guitar that pushes these designs even further with all-around bevels, making it one of the most comfortable guitars ever.</br></br>The S4 is the first model to sport my new 6-inline headstock design ‚Äì a nod to Ken Parker but with easier access to the tuners. It‚Äôs also the first to use a multiscale design, with 27‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ for the low string and 25.5‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ for the high string, making lower tunings sound much more defined and providing more string tension where it‚Äôs most crucial.</br></br>The neck design, as with all of my models, is inspired by aluminum neck guitar construction and though technically a bolt-on, feels more like a neck-through in its playability. The 22 frets are Jescar stainless steel, measuring 2.54 mm wide and 1.19 mm tall, and the fretboard radius is 16‚Ä≤‚Ä≤. The neck profile is my standard C to D shape (with signature volute), and you can choose between 1st and 12th fret depth measurements.</br></br>I offer a variety of wood options for bodies and necks, such as Canadian-sourced Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Poplar or Ash, along with finishes that are kinder to our environment such as Livos natural oil, water-based metallics and solid-colour milk paint. I‚Äôve created a number of custom shades for customers over the years, which you can check out on social media if you need a little inspiration when choosing the specs for your build.</br></br>Pickguards, control knobs and switch tips are designed and printed in-house using quality PLA plastic. The bridge is also unique to Millimetric and is designed and made in-house from aluminum and brass. Tuners are made in the USA by Hipshot Products and are their open gear, locking tuners with modified buttons. Each guitar also comes equipped with a dual action truss rod for accurate adjustment and reliability.</br></br>Electronics are wired in-house using quality components and will be visible on the guitar via its clear acrylic rear cavity cover. I offer a range of original pickups, including:</br></br>MMSC:  Single coil inspired by the Travis Bean 500 pickups.</br>MMSCZ: Noise cancelling version of the MMSC.</br>MMFT: Filtertron-inspired humbucker.</br>MMHB : Humbucker design with magnet pole pieces, offering more definition than a regular humbucker.</br>MMGF: Faithful reproduction of the revered vintage Gold Foil pickup.</br>MMLS: Single coil inspired by lipstick and strat pickups.</br>MMFB: Faithful recreation of a Firebird pickup.</br>MM90: The classic P90 sound.</br></br>Contact me if you don‚Äôt see a pickup that you want, I‚Äôll be happy to help.</br></br>Cases are custom made for Millimetric in Montr√©al with quality materials and waterjet-cut foam interiors.</br></p>

                                <h2>MG6</h2>
                                <p class="descr">The MG6 was the first Millimetric guitar design developed & introduced to the range. The MG6 is arguably the boldest Millimetric design, and was inspired by the work of respected guitar brands, Travis bean & Obstructures. It was intended to be ambidextrous meaning left handed players could have a guitar that looks ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô and is a symmetrical, double cut design with incredible upper fret access. Although it‚Äôs aesthetic was of course an important factor, the tone and sound created by the guitar was a driving force behind some of the design choices. It was intended to pay homage to the noise rock scene hailing from Chicago in the 1990s with bands such as Shellac and Jesus Lizard, creating clarity, a large frequency response, sustain and punch which can also benefit more musical and playing styles too due to the dynamic nature of the sound.</br>The scale length is 25‚Äù giving the MG6 a tighter feel which also lends itself very well to heavier string gauges too if you favour those. This design has become synonymous with our brand, and a key instrument in our 6 string range.</br></br>Although you may not see detailed inlay work for example on our instruments, our emphasis instead is on accurate, consistent and quality construction. With attention to detail on fine fretwork, playability and design.</br></br>The neck design, as with all of our models, is inspired by aluminium neck guitar construction and although technically is a bolt-on neck design, feels more like a through neck in it‚Äôs playability. It also aids the overall resonance due to the strings being anchored on the same piece of wood. The 22 frets are Jescar stainless steel measuring 2.54mm wide and 1.19mm tall, and the fretboard is 12‚Äù radius. Neck profile is our standard D to C shape (with signature volute), and you have the choice of 1st and 12th fret rough depth measurements</br></br>We offer a variety of body and neck wood choices, which are common Canadian sourced materials such as Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Poplar or Ash along with finishes which are kinder to our environment such as Livos natural oil, water based metallics or solid colour milk paint. There has been a wide variety of customer requested colours and many of these final instruments can be seen on our social media accounts if you require some inspiration for the direction of your build.</br></br>Pickguard, control knobs, switch tip are designed and made in house from acrylic and ABS plastic (with brass insert) respectively. The bridge is also unique to Millimetric, designed and made in house from stainless steel and brass. Tuners are made in the USA by Hipshot products, and are their open gear, locking tuners with modified buttons. Strap buttons are recessed into the body for a cleaner aesthetic, and included with the guitar is a set of Dunlop strap locks to suit. Each guitar also comes equipped with a dual action truss rod for accurate adjustment and reliability.</br></br>Electronics are located behind the bridge on this model to continue our ambidextrous intentions. They are wired in house, using quality components and will be visible on the guitar via it‚Äôs clear acrylic rear cavity cover. We offer a range of our own design pickups, including :</br>MMSC | A Single coil inspired by the Travis Bean 500 pickups</br>MMSCZ | A noise cancelling version of the MMSC</br>MMFT | A filter‚Äôtron inspired humbucker</br>MMHB | A humbucker design with magnet pole pieces</br>MMGF | A faithful reproduction of the revered vintage Gold Foil pickup</br>MMLS | A single coil inspired by lipstick and strat pickups</br></p>

                                <h2>MGS2</h2>
                                <p class="descr">The MGS2 was the third Millimetric 6 string guitar design introduced to the range. It is an elegant, symmetrical hip, single cut design, taking inspiration from some of the classic guitar designs of the past but in a more minimalist form. You will find access to the upper frets of the neck is very comfortable and easy due to the deeper single cut and shaped neck heel. This was our first model to feature a 25.5‚Äù scale length, so even with the modern aesthetic, it‚Äôs playability feels familiar to guitarists used to classic bolt-on neck guitars from California for example. This design is very clean, respectful of the classics yet innovative.</br></br>Although you may not see detailed inlay work for example on our instruments, our emphasis instead is on accurate, consistent and quality construction. With attention to detail on fine fretwork, playability and design.</br></br>The neck design, as with all of our models, is inspired by aluminium neck guitar construction and although technically is a bolt-on neck design, feels more like a through neck in it‚Äôs playability. It also aids the overall resonance due to the strings being anchored on the same piece of wood. The 22 frets are Jescar stainless steel measuring 2.54mm wide and 1.19mm tall, and the fretboard is 12‚Äù radius. Neck profile is our standard D to C shape (with signature volute), and you have the choice of 1st and 12th fret rough depth measurements of 19mm to 20mm, 20mm to 21mm or 21mm to 22mm.</br></br>We offer a variety of body and neck wood choices, which are common Canadian sourced materials such as Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Poplar or Ash along with finishes which are kinder to our environment such as Livos natural oil, water based metallics or solid colour milk paint. There has been a wide variety of customer requested colours and many of these final instruments can be seen on our social media accounts if you require some inspiration for the direction of your build.</br></br>Pickguard, control knobs, switch tip are designed and made in house from acrylic and ABS plastic (with brass insert) respectively. The bridge is also unique to Millimetric, designed and made in house from stainless steel and brass. Tuners are made in the USA by Hipshot products, and are their open gear, locking tuners with modified buttons. Strap buttons are recessed into the body for a cleaner aesthetic, and included with the guitar is a set of Dunlop strap locks to suit. Each guitar also comes equipped with a dual action truss rod for accurate adjustment and reliability.</br></br>Electronics are wired in house, using quality components and will be visible on the guitar via it‚Äôs clear acrylic rear cavity cover. We offer a range of our own design pickups, including :</br>MMSC | A Single coil inspired by the Travis Bean 500 pickups</br>MMSCZ | A noise cancelling version of the MMSC</br>MMFT | A filter‚Äôtron inspired humbucker</br>MMHB | A humbucker design with magnet pole pieces</br>MMGF | A faithful reproduction of the revered vintage Gold Foil pickup</br>MMLS | A single coil inspired by lipstick and strat pickups</p>

                                <p class="descr">Our latest baritone guitar model, released in 2020. The MGBS2 is the 28.5‚Äù scale baritone version of our MGS2 single cutaway guitar design. Although 3‚Äù longer in scale length than it‚Äôs MGS2 sibling, the MGBS2 retains it‚Äôs classic guitar design appeal and offers fans of low tunings a well balanced instrument to play. Body shape takes inspiration from classic guitar designs of the past, but in a more modern, minimalist form.</br></br>The neck design, as with all of our models, is inspired by aluminium neck guitar construction and although technically is a bolt-on neck design, feels more like a through neck in it‚Äôs playability. It also aids the overall resonance due to the strings being anchored on the same piece of wood. The 22 frets are Jescar stainless steel measuring 2.54mm wide and 1.19mm tall, and the fretboard is 12‚Äù radius. Neck profile is our standard D to C shape (with signature volute), and you have the choice of 1st and 12th fret rough depth measurements of 19mm to 20mm, 20mm to 21mm or 21mm to 22mm.</br></br></br>We offer a variety of body and neck wood choices, which are common Canadian sourced materials such as Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Poplar or Ash along with finishes which are kinder to our environment such as Livos natural oil, water based metallics or solid colour milk paint. There has been a wide variety of customer requested colours and many of these final instruments can be seen on our social media accounts if you require some inspiration for the direction of your build.</br></br>Pickguard, control knobs, switch tip are designed and made in house from acrylic and ABS plastic (with brass insert) respectively. The bridge is also unique to Millimetric, designed and made in house from stainless steel and brass. Tuners are made in the USA by Hipshot products, and are their open gear, locking tuners with modified buttons. Strap buttons are recessed into the body for a cleaner aesthetic, and included with the guitar is a set of Dunlop strap locks to suit. Each guitar also comes equipped with a dual action truss rod for accurate adjustment and reliability.</br></br></br>Electronics are wired in house, using quality components and will be visible on the guitar via it‚Äôs clear acrylic rear cavity cover. We offer a range of our own design pickups, including :</br>MMSC | A Single coil inspired by the Travis Bean 500 pickups</br>MMSCZ | A noise cancelling version of the MMSC</br>MMFT | A filter‚Äôtron inspired humbucker</br>MMHB | A humbucker design with magnet pole pieces</br>MMGF | A faithful reproduction of the revered vintage Gold Foil pickup</br>MMLS | A single coil inspired by lipstick and strat pickups</br></p>

                                <h2>MB4</h2>
                                <p class="descr">The MB4 was our first bass design developed and introduced to the range and features a modified version of the MG6 guitar shape to better suit the longer scale and size of the bass. The MB4 is a 33‚Äù or 30‚Äô‚Äô scale bass.</br>The MG6 guitar was arguably the boldest Millimetric design, and was inspired by the work of respected guitar brands, Travis bean & Obstructures. The MB4 bass is also true to that direction and influence, also creating a bass with a bold design. It too was intended to be ambidextrous meaning left handed players could have a bass that looks ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô. It is a symmetrical hip, double cut design (with deeper horns) & features incredible upper fret access. Although it‚Äôs aesthetic was of course an important factor, the tone and sound created by the bass was a driving force behind some of the design choices. It was intended to pay homage to the noise rock scene hailing from Chicago in the 1990s with bands such as Shellac and Jesus Lizard, creating clarity, a large frequency response, sustain and punch which can also benefit more musical and playing styles too due to the dynamic nature of the sound.</br></br>Although you may not see detailed inlay work for example on our instruments, our emphasis instead is on accurate, consistent and quality construction. With attention to detail on fine fretwork, playability and design.</br></br>The neck design, as with all of our models, is inspired by aluminium neck guitar and bass construction and although technically is a bolt-on neck design, feels more like a through neck in it‚Äôs playability. It also aids the overall resonance due to the strings being anchored on the same piece of wood. The 21 frets are Jescar stainless steel measuring 2.54mm wide and 1.19mm tall, and the fretboard is 12‚Äù radius. Neck profile is our standard C to D shape (with signature volute), and you have the choice of 1st and 12th fret rough depth measurements of 19mm to 20mm, 20mm to 21mm or 21mm to 22mm.</br></br>We offer a variety of body and neck wood choices, which are common Canadian sourced materials such as Maple, Cherry, Walnut, Poplar or Ash along with finishes which are kinder to our environment such as Livos natural oil, water based metallics or solid colour milk paint. There has been a wide variety of customer requested colours and many of these final instruments can be seen on our social media accounts if you require some inspiration for the direction of your build.</br></br>Pickguard, control knobs, switch tip are designed and made in house from acrylic and PLA plastic (with brass insert) respectively. The bridge is also unique to Millimetric, designed and made in house from stainless steel and brass. Tuners are made by Hipshot products, and are their ultralight series. Strap buttons are recessed into the body for a cleaner aesthetic, and included with the guitar is a set of Dunlop strap locks to suit. Each guitar also comes equipped with a dual action truss rod for accurate adjustment and reliability.</br></br>Electronics are wired in house, using quality components and will be visible on the bass via it‚Äôs clear acrylic rear cavity cover.</p>
